# Airport
===============================
We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.

## Process
1. Write a README.md
2. User story: As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport
And here is a functional representation of that story:
| Objects       | Messages      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|an air traffic controller|      |
|Passanger|get  to a destination |
|Plane|can land at the airport|
|Airport|allows plane to land|

Airport <---- allows plane to land
3. Create an Airport class and test
4.
